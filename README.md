### What it does

- Service discovery and load balancing

- Storage orchestration

- Automated rollouts and rollbacks

- Automatic bin packing

- Self-healing

- Secret and configuration management

### Deployments

### Scheduler
In Kubernetes, scheduling refers to making sure that Pods are matched to Nodes so that Kubelet can run them.

A scheduler watches for newly created Pods that have no Node assigned. For every Pod that the scheduler discovers, the scheduler becomes responsible for finding the best Node for that Pod to run on. The scheduler reaches this placement decision taking into account the scheduling principles described below.



### Taint
Node affinity is a property of pods that attracts them to a set of nodes (either as a preference or a hard requirement). Taints are the opposite â€“ they allow a node to repel a set of pods.

Taints and tolerations work together to ensure that pods are not scheduled onto inappropriate nodes. One or more taints are applied to a node; this marks that the node should not accept any pods that do not tolerate the taints. Tolerations are applied to pods, and allow (but do not require) the pods to schedule onto nodes with matching taints.


# Setup Scheduler
- error with step 1 deploy
`kubectl create -f gpushare-schd-extender.yaml`
get error: `error: unable to recognize "gpushare-schd-extender.yaml": no matches for kind "Deployment" in version "extensions/v1beta1"`
refer to issue: https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/issues/5420

solution: migrate to new api `apps/v1` in the YAML file gpushare-schd-extender.yaml
refer to doc: https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/07/18/api-deprecations-in-1-16/

### Setup Device Plugin
update api based on https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/07/18/api-deprecations-in-1-16/
ignore validation error
